Accessing arrays within arrays (nested arrays):

To access the elements of the inner arrays, you simply use two sets of square brackets. For example, pets[1][2] accesses the 3rd element of the array inside the 2nd element of the pets array.

function htmlToggle() {
  var x = document.getElementById("html-section");
  if (x.style.display === "block") {
    x.style.display = "none";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "block";
  }
}
