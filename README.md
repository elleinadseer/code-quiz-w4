# code-quiz-w4

## Description

I have been tasked to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. I have utilised dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code which has created an interactive quiz that stores scores and and initials into local storage. The quiz works off a timer that can be influenced by the outcome of the quiz (i.e. a wrong question subtracts 10 seconds from the timer.) When the clock reaches 0, the quiz ends.

## Development

I struggled with this task a lot. The CSS side of things was easy to complete; however the aspects involving local storage and array usage were things I really struggled with. I will have to read more into the subjects to increase my fluency with these ideas. I wanted to make the website look as close to the example provided, while I recognise it was not a requirement, but I had to remove certain features of the original as I couldn't work out how to implement the clear highscores function. I find this regretful and want to work harder to overcome this. 

## Usage

Although I wasn't perfectly able to replicate the example website you will see below it is largely similar:

## Credits

I have heavily relied on lessons taught through the module 4 and 5 lessons of the bootcamp; copying and then editing code from the lessons of this module to fit my needs. I also benefited from advice given directly by our tutors. I also did some minor googling to receive information that I did not use heavily enough to require attribution.
